## Abstract
Visualizing data requires thinking beyond the common types of chart such as bar/line/pie. Fortunately, numerous developer libraries such as amCharts and D3 make it easy to create interactive, dynamic, and informative graphics for web applications. It's necessary to consider the appropriate methods for data charts in order to make a compelling, and accurate, visualization for people to understand.

In this session, we'll cover the principles of data visualization and some useful techniques and methods you can apply to your own work. Also, learn how to use developer libraries like Cedar and D3 with ArcGIS APIs to craft custom data visualizations in your mapping applications and share them with other developers.
