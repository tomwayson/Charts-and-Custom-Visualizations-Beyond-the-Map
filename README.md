## Abstract
Visualizing data requires thinking beyond the common types of chart such as bar/line/pie. It's necessary to consider the appropriate methods for data charts in order to make a compelling, and accurate, visualization for people to understand. In this session, we'll cover the principles of data visualization and some useful techniques and methods you can apply to your own work. Also, learn how to use JavaScript libraries like Cedar and AmCharts with ArcGIS APIs to craft custom data visualizations in your web applications and share them with other developers.
